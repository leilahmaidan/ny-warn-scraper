          New York State Felt The Hit of April’s Jobs Report

          The wide-spread devastation caused by the global pandemic and
          lockdowns brought the U.S. economy to its knees in April, as the
          unemployment rate surged to a record-breaking 14.7% and, wiped out the
          last 20 years of job gains. New York State was not spared as it took a
          high hit of losses in the restaurant and hotel sector.

            The monthly report, released by The Labor Department, reflected the
            widespread impact of the virus as the economy took away 20.5 million
            jobs in one month. Low-wage workers made up the brunt of the losses.
            The percentage of the adult population with a job now stands at an
            unprecedented 51.3%.

          These numbers do not even include the number of people who are still
          employed in the sectors but have had their hours slashed
          substantially. Since the lockdowns began, some restaurants remined
          open for takeout only and under limited hours. Employees that once
          worked full days now work less hours, while tips for in-house dinning
          have been diminished with takeout.

        <p class="g-copy">
          As for hotels, the few chains that were able to remain open were ones
          that secured government contracts and private sector contracts related
          to putting up healthcare workers who had come into the state to fight
          COVID-19. The rest were forced to all but shut down due to the lack of
          travelers.

        <p class="g-copy">
          Economists’ worry that some of the losses may become permanent as
          businesses struggle to recover while others shut down for good. Even
          when the economy starts to slowly re-open, most businesses won’t be
          able to operate at full capacity. Restaurants and shops may need to
          limit the number of customers they take in, while consumers may be
          afraid to go out or spend money. While it may take people some time
          before they are comfortable traveling again, leaving hotels struggling
          to fill rooms even after the lockdowns end.

        <p class="g-copy">
          Though not all economists are looking at it negatively.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “The data represents the rear-view mirror,” said Thomas Hayes,
          Chairman of Great Hill Capital. “… People are underestimating the
          impact that all of the stimulus will have by [the fourth quarter of]
          2020 and [the first half of] 2021. It'll be bumpy in the interim with
          more rear-view looking ‘bad news’,’ but the worst is behind us.,”
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Other economists believe the recovery will not depend on any economic
          factors such as a re-opening or a stimulus package, but a vaccine. “If
          the pandemic is not addressed by the medical and scientific
          communities, that is, if there isn’t a vaccine [found], we have longer
          periods of low economic growth or contraction with elevated rates,”
          said Brusuelas
